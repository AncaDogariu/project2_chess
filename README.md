-implemented the solutions for the methods in order to pass all 
the tests created for verifying some concrete situations( in ChessBoard.java and
Pawn.java are these methods)

-some other test which would be nice to implement for this chess game
are: one or more tests for movement of another type of piece, like the 
movement of a knight(L shape )
